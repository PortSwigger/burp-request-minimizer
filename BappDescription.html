<p>This extension performs HTTP request minimization. It deletes parameters that are not relevant, such as: random ad cookies, cachebusting nonces etc.</p>

<p>Two actions are added to the context menu in Repeater: Minimize in current tab and minimize in new tab.</p>

<p>As each parameter is removed, the extension repeats the request to ensure the response matches. Only parameters that do not affect the response are removed.</p>
